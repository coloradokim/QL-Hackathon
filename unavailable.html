    <p>Me: emotionally unavailable, and very busy.
You: Must have a busy schedule. This must be legit. Attending a coding bootcamp, while working two jobs, running a business, publishing original research=busy. Sleeping in until 2 in the afternoon, toking up with your friends, watching re-runs of “West Wing”=not busy.
That way, we can always blame everything on “timing.” (It’s not you or me) </p>
