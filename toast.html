  <h2>whatâ€™s ur favorite pop-tart?</h2>

<p> I'm looking for that special someone who will share my passion for toast. All kinds of toast -- white toast, whole-wheat toast, rye toast, toasted bagels (and when I'm feeling wild and crazy, a Pop Tart.) To me, toast is the ultimate turn-on. There is nothing like a man who smells like toast! I picture us sitting on a couch in front of my sixty toasters, getting nice and toasty, sipping brandy from glasses with croutons floating in them, talking endlessly about the splendors of toast. Perhaps one day you will ask me to spread butter and jam on your body. Or cream cheese -- I'm not particular. Are you that special person?</p>
